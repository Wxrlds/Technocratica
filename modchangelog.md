		compactmachines3-1.12.2-3.0.18-b278.jar:

		Ender IO - 5.0.44:
			You need either the main file or a selection of the "split" jars, not both!

			[Changelog (this build)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fci.tterrag.com%252fjob%252fEnderIO-Modules%252fjob%252fEnderIO-Combined%252f44%252fchanges) / [Changelog (all builds)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fci.tterrag.com%252fjob%252fEnderIO-Modules%252fjob%252fEnderIO-Combined%252fchanges)

	Ender IO Endergy (went from Ender IO endergy - 5.0.43 to Ender IO endergy - 5.0.44):

	Equivalent Integrations (went from v0.4.5 to v0.4.6):
		v0.4.6:
			This should be the final release in the v0.4 series, I hope!

			Fixed:

			 * Transmutation chamber inconsistent about which items it will accept ([#35](https://github.com/pkmnfrk/equivalentintegrations/issues/35))
			 * Transmutation chamber can be very laggy when inserting items ([#35](https://github.com/pkmnfrk/equivalentintegrations/issues/35))

		ExtremeReactors-1.12.2-0.4.5.66.jar:
			- I've changed the way Reactors and Turbines send out the available power each tick. They will do it now in only one go, by assigning an equal amount of power to each power tap. Each power tap will then send their share to the linked cable/machine up to the amount that the cable/machine accept. Any amount of power not accepted by the cable/machine will remain in the internal buffer of the Reactor or Turbine. In the end you may need more power taps in your Reactor or Turbine. Close #201

			- Bumped version to 0.4.5.66

			 * Disabled JourneyMap integration by default - LatvianModder

	FastFurnace (went from FastFurnace-1.12.2-1.3.0.jar to FastFurnace-1.12.2-1.3.1.jar):
		FastFurnace-1.12.2-1.3.1.jar:
			Added a config option to not check caps when doing furnace outputs.
