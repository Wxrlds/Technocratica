![Technocratica Overview](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Technocratica/BH_T_OVERVIEW.png)

<center>
Start at a stage where the Energy that's used was exclusive to certain machines but as technology advanced it was interchangeable only to be almost forgotten until an unknown engineer developed a highly advanced machine which relied on that ancient Energy thus, it will be remembered for a long time. Early on you discover the ability to create pocket dimensions which allows you to make builds very compact.

Rediscover the forgotten alchemical knowledge of ProjectE only to find out that the alchemical way of doing things has been mostly forgotten therefore the only way to advance is with highly complex machinery. Become a demigod by compressing the world into a singular spot only killable through your own technology.

<ul>
    • Contains a Quest Book to guide you through the different progression lines and the final goal to craft the creative items for infinite energy, items, fluids and gases<br>
    • The progression is going to lead you through almost every single mod<br>
    • Be warned if you play this, the Mobs aren't your best friends...<br>
    • Also make sure you can see in the dark ;)
</ul>
